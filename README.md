In the Uber data project, I used Jupyter Notebooks for data cleansing with Python and Pandas. I then configured VMs on Google Cloud, linked to Google Storage for data. Analysis was done in BigQuery, with Mage-AI for ETL, and Looker for dashboard visualization. This project enhanced my professional expertise in data engineering with practical application of key technologies.
